## More hoops

Now letâ€™s add more hoops. The design uses 6 intersecting hoops. Each hoop is moved away from the centre and rotated a different amount. 

--- task ---
If you look at the design, there's no hoop in the centre. The hoops are all moved out from the centre.

Let's `translate`{:class="blockscadtransforms"} (move) the first hoop into position.

Now the hoop is a little off centre.

Now we need multiple copies of this hoop, rotated around the centre.  First let's create 3 equally space hoops using a `count`{:class="blockscadloops"} loop and `rotate`{:class="blockscadtransforms"}.

	The count goes from 1 to 3 and sets the `i` variable. Each hoop is rotated by `i` times 120 to space the hoops equally around the 360 degrees of a circle. 
	
	Look at the code and make sure you understand how it works.

The finished design has 6 hoops rather than 3. Change your code so that it creates 6 equally spaced hoops.

You'll need to change the `count`{:class="blockscadloops"} loop so that it runs 6 times instead of 3. And the 6 hoops will need to be equally spaced around 360.

need to change the loop to run from 1 to 6 and move in multiples of 60 degrees (360 / 60 = 60):

Your code should look like this:
