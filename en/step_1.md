## Introduction

In this project, you will use BlocksCAD to design a pendant that can be 3D printed. The pendant uses a geometric design based on the flower of life; this design is often found in historical art. 

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a desktop computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing.

If you have access to a 3D printer, then you can print your pendant. The pendant is small and only uses a little bit of filament, and it is quick to 3D print.

### What you will make

The finished pendant looks like this:

The pendant has a loop on top so that you can put it on a necklace or cord. 

The pendant measures 40mm across, plus the hoop for hanging. It’s 2mm deep, so it will 3D print quite quickly.

Don’t worry if you don’t like this design. After this project, you’ll be able to code your own design and create a custom pendant.
