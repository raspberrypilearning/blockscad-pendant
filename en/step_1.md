## Introduction

In this project you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D printable pendant that you can wear or give as a gift. The pendant uses a geometric design based on the flower of life, this design freequently features in historical art. 

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a desktop computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing.

If you have access to a 3D printer then you can print your pendant. The resulting pendant doesn’t use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print.

### What you will make

The finished pendant looks like this:

The pendant has a loop on top so you can put it on a necklace or cord. 

The pendant is 40mm across plus the hoop for hanging. It’s 2mm deep so it will 3D print quite quickly.

Don’t worry if you don’t like this design. After this project you’ll be able to code your own design and create a custom pendant.
