## Challenge: Change it!

--- challenge ---
Experiment with changing values in your pendant. Try changing the numbers of hoops or the amount that you translate the inner hoops by. 

What if you use cuboids (cubes) instead of cylinders to create a pattern?
Tip: Youâ€™ll need to centre the cuboids as they are defined from a corner, not the centre.
