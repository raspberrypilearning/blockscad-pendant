## 3D Printing and Assembly

BlocksCAD 3D can export an `.STL` file for 3D printing. 

+ Render your model and then click `Generate STL`. Remember where you save the file. 

+ There are lots of tools that can read STL files and send 3D models to a printer. 

	The one you choose will depend on the 3D printer that you are using. 

+ Very carefully remove the 3D print from the print bed. The pendant is thin so it's quite delicate.

+ You may need to tidy up the print by removing any small strands of filament especially from the hanging hoop. 

+ Thread the pendant on a chain or cord. If you want to use a thicker cord or necklace then you can adjust the design to have a larger hanging loop.
